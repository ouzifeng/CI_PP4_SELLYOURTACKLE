# Sell Your Tackle

### Use Case

A large fishing tackle shop chain has approach me to help them solve a business related problem they are facing regarding sales growth. As one of the largest chains, they already have the purchasing power to price new tackle competitively in the market, and have maxed out growth in this area. 

Their executive team has tasked the chief revenue officer to find new avenues for revenue growth. One area she is keen to grow into is the used tackle market. The executive team likes this idea, but they want to protect their brand equity by first testing the model under a different business name "Sell Your Tackle" while they learn the ins and outs of running a C2C business. 

Their leadership team has approached me with a clear and well defined scope of exactly what they need, and have asked me to excecute the build for them
